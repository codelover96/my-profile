My Personal Profile
This is the repository of my personal website. I made it public to showcase my work.
It is not intended to be a repository which you can clone and upload for yourself as it contains 
pesonal information. Though, this project is completely open source and you can definitely fork it,
change every information related to myself and distribute/upload it on your behalf, considering
you like the look and feel.

Cheers,
